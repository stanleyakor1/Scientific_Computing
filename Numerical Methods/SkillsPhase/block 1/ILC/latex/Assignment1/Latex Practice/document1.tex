\section{Introduction}\label{basics}
A first course in programming for the Computer Science student. Emphasis will be on program specification, analysis, problem solving and implementation using an object-oriented language such as JAVA. Topics include definitions of classes and objects, algorithm development and methods, primitive and reference data types, arrays, strings, and operators. Successful completion of this course with a C or better is required for further progress in Computer degree programs. Several major programming projects will be assigned to be completed outside of class and lab. Three class hours, two laboratory hours. Completion of this course with a C or better is required before taking any other CSC courses.
this is a brief introduction of myself
